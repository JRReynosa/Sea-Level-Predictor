### freeCodeCamp Assignment

Anaylize a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880 & use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.

Unit tests are written under `test_module.py`.

Code can be run at https://replit.com/@JRReynosa/Sea-Level-Predictor#sea_level_predictor.py

Final graph is sea_level_plot.png
